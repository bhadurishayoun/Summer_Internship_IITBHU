# Face_Msk_Recognition
In this project, main aim was to develop a face recognition system that can recognise the faces along with occlusion such as mask.
This project consist of MTCNN as the Face Detector Algorithm, Facenet as Face Recognition Algorithm/Model and lastly SVM for classification. 
The model gives an accuracy of 99.89% 
I also used data augmentation to increase the number of test cases.
