# Summer_Internship_IITBHU
This repository contains the code files and discrition for the work done in summer internship  at IIT BHU under Dr. Pratik Chattopadhyay
In this internship I worked on Two Major projects:- 1. Face Mask Recognition,  2. Pose De-identification.
The main aim of both projects was to understand the pattern and working architecture of the state of the art models in face recognition and pose deidentification and to enhance them so that they can yield more better and clear results.
# Face Mask Recogniton
In this project, main aim was to develop a face recognition system that can recognise the faces along with occlusion such as mask.
This project consist of MTCNN as the Face Detector Algorithm, Facenet as Face Recognition Algorithm/Model and lastly SVM  for classification.
The model gives an accuracy of 99.89%
I also used data augmentation to increase the number of test cases.
# Pose Deidentification
The main aim of the project is to preserve the identity of a person either in the image or in video. 
We focus of protecting the privacy of the person so that there is no breach of his privacy.
We have used  Autoencoders and GANs for this as it requires the generation of new image.
The basic explanation of the project is :-" We take two images as input and fuse them pixelwise and generate a new image that contains some features from both the images"
